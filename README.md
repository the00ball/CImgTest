# CImgTest

The CImgTest is a simple project to test the [CImg Library](http://cimg.eu). It was developed over Eclipe CDT enviroment but it is not mandatory. Anyway, the projetc does not have a makefile and if you wish to use other editor/enviroment more confortable to you, you will need to write a makefile or compile it by command line.

The Project consists in four tests:

* Edge Detection
* Button Search
* Motion Detection
* Show Regions

## Enviroment

This repository is pre-configured for Eclipse CDT enviroment: Eclipse Neon. 1a Release(4.6.1). (not mandatory)

## Dependencies

* Linux enviroment(Developed over Ubuntu 16.10)
* Eclipse Neon. 1a Release(4.6.1) or more recent version; (not mandatory)
* CDT enviroment; (not mandatory)
* Lib x11;
* Lib png;
* Lib jpeg;
* Lib OpenCV;
* Tesseract tesseract-ocr with English;

## Testing the Program

If you run it with no command line options, just doing ./CImgTest, the program will start motion detection. To retrive command line options use --help option.
